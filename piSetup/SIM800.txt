Disable linux's usage of serial port.
- sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service # Stops service
- sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service # Disables service

Setup pppd:
- cp configFiles/sim800 to /etc/ppp/peers/
- Note: script is currently setup to use Cricket network, application will
  need to turn off pppd and edit config file to change APN.
- cp configFiles/1add-default-route /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/
  
Setup chatscript that pppd will use to issue AT commands:
- cp configFiles/gprs to /etc/chatscripts/

Need to add user to dialout group to access sim800 as serial port:
- sudo usermod -a -G dialout bjn

Need to add sudo policies to allow user to turn pppd on and off. Assuming
application runs under the username "bjn":
- cp configFiles/pppd /etc/sudoers.d/

Install python-pip and pyserial to allow communication with AT commands:
  sudo apt-get install python-pip
  pip install pyserial

Connection can be turned on and off with:
- sudo pon sim800
- sudo poff sim800
